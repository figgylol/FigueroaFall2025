        <P>Sarcodon squamosus, also known as Scaly Tooth, is a large mushroom that has a coarsely scaly, pale brown cap with dark greyish, spiny under-surface. It grows particularly with pines, solitary or in scattered groups, on the soil in coniferous woods (Source: Mushroom World).</P>

        <P style="margin-left: 100px;">"From the point of view of mushroom dyeing, it is significant as one of the only mushroom species that can dye with shades of blue.[3] Brown shades are obtained from young mushrooms, while older, almost mature ones give rarer shades of blue, turquoise and green.[2]"</P>
