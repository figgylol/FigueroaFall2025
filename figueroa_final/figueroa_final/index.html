         <h2>Welcome to Game Worlds</h2>
            <p>Have you ever re-discovered a scent that you can distinctly remember from your childhood? One that you had completely forgotten about until smelling it again? Maybe you have a song that you associate with a specific memory, and upon hearing it you are transported back to a certain time? There is an unbreakable connection between the things we experience and where we were when we experienced them. Video game worlds, due to their distinct and memorable locations, have been perfect time capsules for me as I've grown up.  </p>
       
        <h3>World Building in Games</h3>
            <p>Game environments are carefully designed to create atmosphere and guide the player. From lighting and music to architecture and scale, developers love to evoke those "ooh"s, "ahh"s and "wow"s out of their players.</p>
        
        <h3>Why They Matter</h3>
            <p>These environments are artistic landscapes that many pass and forget in a matter of minutes. They are part of a greater whole within the game, but it doesn't mean that they matter any less. Anything can leave an impression. I also believe that there is significance to highlighting the importance of creative digital experiences in this day and age, where it can feel like the world is becoming progressively bleaker as technology advances. </p>
