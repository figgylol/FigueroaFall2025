    <h2>Shadow of the Colossus</h2>
    <p class="galleryh2-paragraph">Shadow of the Colossus stands out for its minimalism, especially when played nowadays. It's lonely, and subtle in its narrative. From a gameplay perspective, it's also very unique. It focuses solely on grand boss battles, each being unique and feeling like their own puzzle to be solved. When I first tried it, it took a moment to click. I had heard so many good things, so I went in expecting to be blown away. That feeling didn't arrive until I stopped and took a second to really appreciate what I had been playing. The game was so minimal, and I was moving so fast, that to me it felt almost empty. Slowing it down with this game completely changed the way that I've approached any games after. I love to play slow so I can appreciate everything. </p>

    <h2>Resident Evil 4</h2>
    <p class="galleryh2-paragraph">The Resident Evil 4 remake is a game I was nervously excited for. The original RE4 is my favorite game of all time, and I was afraid it wouldn't capture that same magic. When I played it, I was immediately transported back to how I felt the first time I played the original, after having watched my grandfather play it growing up. It was familiar, but completely unique. Even with already knowing the story and locations, I found myself blown away with how captivated I was to keep moving forward and see the next thing. </p>

    <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2>
    <p class="galleryh2-paragraph">The Last of Us 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. Its environments and sound design may be the best I've experienced in any game to date. The story is so compelling, and it feels like you're moving and changing along with its characters. That coupled with the visual and audio design make for an unforgettable immersive experience. Early in the game you are given a space in an dilapidated few streets of Seattle to just go wild and explore. To me it even echoed Shadow of the Colossus. That section of the game, being able to go at your own pace so early on, was favorite few hours played in a video game. Hidden stories told in nooks and crannies that you could've missed, a moment to breathe that contrasted the high-stress and emotionally draining nature of the story that started right from the jump. </p>
